Particular attention is given to the concept and framework of Ecosystem-Based Management, the goal of which is to conserve, maintain and restore ecosystem functions to promote the economic and ecological sustainability of marine ecosystems and human communities that depend on the services they provide. Tomorrowâ€™s marine resource managers must be capable of identifying, requesting, analyzing, synthesizing, and combining natural and social science with experiential knowledge and human/social capital to generate meaningful policy and management recommendations and strategies.",

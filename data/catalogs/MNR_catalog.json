  "description": "Climate change is expected to have profound effects on forests. Society can respond by managing in forests in ways that can help mitigate climate change or help forests adapt. Nonetheless, changes in climate and forest responses are uncertain, making management and policy decisions difficult and controversial. We will investigate the effects of climate change on forests, focusing on potential forest management and policy responses.",

  "course_number": "MNR 550",
  "credits": "3",
  "description": "Forest management responses to climate change rely on understanding the mechanisms of interaction between forests and climate, as well as the capacity to evaluate impacts of future climate scenarios on forests. Considers effects of rising CO2 and changing climate at the level of ecophysiological processes, changes in species distribution, changes in disturbance regimes, and ecosystem-level impacts mediated by the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles. Modeling approaches include statistically-based bioclimatic envelopes, and dynamic global vegetation models that treat ecosystem processes and changes in biome distribution.",

Identifies how the literature, travelogues, and life narratives written in Europe, Africa, and Asia reflect political, religious, philosophical, and artistic interpenetration. Examines how these texts help us redefine the medieval and illuminate modern discourses of the nation-state, debates about race and ethnicity, and the concerns of post- and decoloniality.",

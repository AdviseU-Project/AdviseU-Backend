  "description": "Covers scientific principles of surface and structural characterization techniques. Explores methods to study both macro- and nano-scale properties. Emphasizes surface and interfacial analysis of metals, semiconductors, and dielectric materials. Applies basic knowledge of chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand scientific fundamentals and operating principles of spectroscopy and microscopy-based techniques. Covers a range of experimental methods for determining surface structure, elemental composition, and chemical states. Topics including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, low energy ion scattering, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy.
